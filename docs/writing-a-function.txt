Here's a guide helping to code a function for swifty.
Swifty supports several programming languages, so there are
common things, that apply to all, and some specific.

== Summary ==

First of all, the "function" from swifty point of view is a
language, well, function called Main (capitalized, yes). The
function accepts one argument called "request" which carries
arguments, http method, URL sub-path and more. The function
returns 2 arguments, the first one is anything that's JSON
encodable, the 2nd one is used to control the details of what
should be done after the function execution.

== Request ==

The request is language-specific object, that contains the
following fields in it:

- args   -- query arguments
- body   -- request body (string)
- method -- request method (get, put, delete, post, head, patch)
- claims -- JWT claims object when authentication is ON
- path   -- URL subpath that was used to call function

Few words about the URL subpath. Swifty functions get called by
the URLs looking like

  https://swifty.cloud/call/{functionid}[/{subpath}]

the /call/{funcitonid} part is mandatory, while the /{subpath}
may be of any length and passed as is into function.

== Response ==

In simple cases functions return anything JSON-encodable which
gets returned by swifty to http request in body. The content type
is set to 'application/json', the status code is 200 (OK).

Repsonce object (2nd return value) can be used to change this
behavior in the future (NOTE: nothing is implemented yet). The
response may be a language-specific no-value thing if no
actions are needed.

Actions that are planned to be supported:

- http status code to return
- body content type
- async events


Now examples of functions just returning the "foo" argument value

== Go ==
package main
func Main(req *Request) (interface{}, *Response) {
	return req.Args["foo"], nil
}

== Python ==
def Main(req):
	return req.args["foo"], None

== Ruby ==
def Main(req)
	return req.args["foo"], nil

== JS ==
exports.Main = function(rq) {
	return { req.args.foo, null }
}

== Swift ==
struct Resp: Encodable {
	var msg: String
}

func Main(rq: Request) -> (Encodable, Response?) {
	let result = Resp(msg: "Hello, world")
	return ( result, nil )
}

== CSarp ==
This thing is, well, a bit more complicated as no functions
may exist w/o classes.

using System;

class Message
{
	public string msg;
}

class Function
{
	static public (Message, Response) Main (Request req)
	{
		var ret = new Message();
		ret.msg = "Hello, world!";
		return (ret, null);
	}
}
